# Fitness Inheritance for Evolutionary Algorithms (Platypus Library)

This project implements and evaluates fitness inheritance (FI) strategies in the [Platypus](https://github.com/Project-Platypus/Platypus) Python library for evolutionary computation. Fitness inheritance reduces the computational cost of genetic algorithms by estimating the fitness of some individuals based on their parentsâ€™ fitness, rather than always computing it from scratch.

## ðŸ“š Background

Fitness inheritance was introduced by Smith, Dike, and Stegmann in 1995 as a way to speed up evolutionary algorithms by reducing the number of expensive fitness evaluations. Instead of evaluating every offspring, a portion of them inherit a fitness value estimated from their parents.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Implementation of both **average** and **proportional** fitness inheritance strategies in the Platypus framework.
- Experiments on benchmark functions (e.g., CEC 2014) to compare FI approaches against standard genetic algorithms.
- Statistical analysis of performance (solution quality, computation time, etc.).

## ðŸ“¦ Usage

1. **Clone this repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-github-username/fitness-inheritance-platypus.git
    cd fitness-inheritance-platypus
    ```

2. **Install requirements:**
    ```bash
    pip install platypus-opt numpy pandas matplotlib
    ```

3. **Run experiments:**
    - Use the provided scripts to run genetic algorithms with and without fitness inheritance.
    - Configure FI parameters (inheritance probability, method) as needed in the scripts.

4. **Analyze results:**
    - Compare convergence, number of fitness evaluations, and solution quality.
    - Results and plots will be saved in the `results/` directory.

## ðŸ“Š Example

Example of running a GA with average fitness inheritance:

```python
from platypus import NSGAII, Problem, Real
from fitness_inheritance import GeneticAlgorithmWithFitnessInheritance

problem = Problem(2, 1)
problem.types[:] = [Real(-5, 5), Real(-5, 5)]

algorithm = GeneticAlgorithmWithFitnessInheritance(problem, fitness_inheritance="average", inheritance_probability=0.5)
algorithm.run(10000)
